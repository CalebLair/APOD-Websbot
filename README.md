# APOD websbot
A simple program that pulls info from NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD) website and displays it locally in a GUI built from tkinter
# How to install
This assumes you have python and pip already installed and set up
## Installing required libraries
Download the files in the repository and place all of them in their own directory. Nativate to the newly created directory using a command line and use pip to install all 
the important modules which are specified in `requirements.txt`
# Running the program
To run the program, simply navigate to the directory where the files from this repository are located, and use python to run
APODwebsbot.py. It takes a few seconds then the GUI will appear with the information and a button to click to display the picture of the day
# Notes on current version use
Under this updated version it looks to download file extentions jpg, gif, and png but still only displays jpg files to show and everytime I've run the program the file has been
a jpg so in theory there should be no issues here. I've also seen a YouTube video be shown in place of an image and the program downloaded and displayed an image of a sad kitten so that was interesting. Previous issues of image not fitting on screen and potentially showing the wrong image for the correct day have been fixed but better solutions could be implimented.
